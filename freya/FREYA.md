Freya is the task server, making requests to Wotan in a timely manner, having checked its database for the relevant details. It exists as a response to the overly general task triggering libraries that already exist, such as celery. These libraries attempt to allow the user to call an arbitrary python function, sometimes even with pickled python objects, which is disgusting. All I need for my purposes is to make requests to a web server with a small amount of serialised data at the correct time, such as every ten seconds. I do not need to execute arbitrary python classes and functions. My gateway to running a task is consistent. Since individual requests in Django spawn the equivalent of self-contained applications, and since this system is well understood, it is enough to build this task management system on top of it.
